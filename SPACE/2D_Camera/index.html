<p>So lets say you&#39;re helping a friend make a 2D platformer game. They&#39;re a little new at this, so they&#39;re getting a bit stuck. They have a few things already made, like the player, the ground, the inputs, and they even imported <a href="http://brm.io/matter-js/">Matter.js</a> to take care of the physics.</p>

<p>The first thing we should do is take a look at their game and see how it&#39;s working. Try interacting with the game a bit, and read through the code that they&#39;ve written. If you need to restart the game, try editing the code to refresh the canvas. If you feel like you&#39;ve made a mistake in the code, you can also use command+Z or ctrl+Z to undo your changes.</p>

<h3>Wait, what&#39;s Matter.js again?</h3>

<p>If Matter.js is altogether alien to you, it might be worth opening up <a href="http://brm.io/matter-js/docs/">the documentation</a> or looking through <a href="https://github.com/liabru/matter-js/tree/master/examples">the examples</a>. There&#39;s also a good tutorial series on The Coding Train on <a href="https://youtu.be/urR596FsU68">how to use Matter.js with p5</a>. Your friend doesn&#39;t want to spend all day thinking about how to implement physics, so they just settled for using a physics library instead.</p>

You might have noticed a bigger problem with this game though: <strong>it&#39;s pretty small</strong>. Only the size of the game window, in fact. </p>

<p>&quot;How do I make the level bigger?&quot; your friend might ask. Well, we could simply add more elements outside of the canvas so the player box doesn&#39;t fall off into infinity, but that&#39;s not really what they&#39;re asking here, is it? Their real question is:</p>

<h3><em>How might I see more of this world as the player moves around it?</em></h3>

<p>Lets take a moment to reflect on this. In p5, everything is drawn in relation to the origin point (0,0). By default, this is in the top left of the canvas.</p>

<p><code>

<p>This means, in order to see other parts of the game, we&#39;ll have to <strong>move the origin</strong>. What&#39;s more, we need to move the origin <strong>in relation to the player</strong> so that it stays on the screen. So in order to emulate a camera that is following the player along, we&#39;ll need to do both of these.</p>

<h3>In Summary:</h3>

<ul><li>In order to see more of the game, we need to move the origin</li><li>In order to keep the player on the screen, we need to make the origin movements relational to the player object             </li></ul></div></div></div></div><footer id="footer"><div class="inner"><ul class="copyright"><li class="nav-link"><h3> <a href="../../index">Back</a></h3></li><li class="nav-link"><h3><a href="./move-origin">Next: Move the Origin</a></h3></li></ul></div></footer></div></div></body></html>
